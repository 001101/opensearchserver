The Bamboo Touch has arrived to meld the features of multi-touch with the comfort of Wacom's large tablet area. The buzz has settled a little about multi-touch technology lately but its adoption is continuing to grow. First experienced by Apple's users on various Macbook models, multi-touch is showing up on more and more devices.  A few niche manufacturers have created multi-touch pads, but Wacom is the first major name to bring a device to market. The whole Bamboo line is multi-touch enabled, and the Bamboo Touch is the smallest and most affordable of them. The Bamboo Touch brings just the large comfortable touchpad experience for a very nominal price.  Nine basic gestures are supported by the Touch, including Navigate, Click, Double Click, Right Click, Forward & Back, Scroll, Select & Drag, Rotate, and Zoom.  All these gestures are easily and comfortably performed on the 5.4" x 8.2" tablet.  There are also 4 physical buttons for clicks or programming functions or launching macros. The touch area is considerably larger than a laptop touchpad, and should make a decent desktop companion.  At only $69, you can add multi-touch to your iMac or Windows 7 desktops by giving up a USB plug. Permanent Link

This is the governing body that owns the intellectual property and leases that connectivity to the world, but not without rules. The 8.2.1 update to iTunes basically broke a vital selling point for the Palm Pre. One of the Pre's major selling points was its ability to natively sync with iTunes. Apple decided this was enough of an encroachment on the iPhone sales, and decided to have iTunes reject connections with the Pre. Now thousands of Pre users are stuck and aggravated. Palm has brought the matter to the attention of the USB-IF with the accusation that Apple is violating the spirit of inter-connectivity that USB was designed to enable. Palm went further and described the efforts it had to go through to spoof themselves as an Apple device in order to regain connection. While the original intention of this hardware ID was to enable PCs to correctly identify drivers, it has become a tool for business to control operation with their software. Unfortunately for Palm, the steps it was 'forced' to resort to are a violation of the letter of the USB-IF's policies. Palm now has to answer for that violation of the letter of the law and has denied Palm's claim that Apple is in the wrong. Hair-pulling and clawing is about to ensue, we're sure. Stayed tuned, the next tantrum will likely land them both on Springer. Permanent Link

USB counterparts hit big time with its universal compatibility and more recently the addition of DisplayLink USB video.  Kensington has just overhauled its aging sd200v notebook dock with two major upgrades: HD video output and auto install.   The new dock, now called sd400v, has been upgraded with DisplayLink's DL-195 to enable display resolutions up to 2048 x 1152.  720p and 1080p are supported if you add a DVI-to-HDMI adapter.  The $149.99 sd400v has a DVI-I for video output. Auto-install is particularly interesting as the sd400v would no longer require users to first install software drivers before plugging in the dock (although installation does happen in the background).  This makes the sd400v pretty close to true plug-and-play.  You will find 4 USB ports, stereo sound jack, DVI and an 10/100 Ethernet on the back.  The audio (headphone and mic) ports and 1 always-on USB port for charging mobile devices even if the notebook is shut down are on the front.  This one won't support Mac out of the box, however.  There's model without Ethernet and auto-install that goes for $129.99. Permanent Link

Granted, there aren't any motherboards nor built-in OS drivers available, but Freecom has USB 3.0 cards for both laptop and desktop PCs, and these come with proprietary drivers. Aimed squarely at consumer users, external drive offers speeds of up to 130MBytes/s (or 1040Mb/s); in comparison, the fastest USB 2.0 drive maxes out at 40MBytes/s (or 320Mb/s).  Better silicons both for SATA bridge and host will emerge to further improve throughput so it's likely performance of future USB 3.0 drives will double.  The Hard Drive XS 3.0 also sports hardware encryption with AES 256-bit strength.  Freecom expects to ship the 3.5" SuperSpeed USB drive in mid-November starting at 1TB for £99.99; the USB 3.0 PCIe card and ExpressCard will hit retail the same time for £23 and £26 respectively.

Designed to support the high bandwidth needs that will accompany the new SuperSpeed USB mode, the cables contain special circuitry to maintain USB 3.0 signal quality which peripherals are particular sensitive at such high speed.  Applications (e.g. video editing) that can make use of the amount of data that USB 3.0 will offer will be less tolerant of errors or signal problems.  Accell 's cables utilize corrective circuitry that allows them to reach a length of 6 meters.  In comparison, hardware and cables previously being tested started to see fatal amounts of errors and jitter after 3 meters, which is the length limit to passive USB 3.0 cable.  The new connective technology requires no extra power, and the cables aren't any thicker than today's USB cables and will be available in a variety of lengths while of course the connectors would be larger to accommodate the extra pins. Video and storage applications will most likely be the first applications that require cables of this quality.  Expect to see advanced peripherals and perhaps even a transformation of the computer altogether.  USB 3.0 brings data transfer capabilities that have traditionally been restricted to the motherboard.  USB video, notebook docks, audio, add on processing units with parallelism and cheap, secure, thin client systems could hit the scenes very quickly taking advantage of game-changing speed that SuperSpeed USB brings.  These cables, available in 3m, 4, 5 and 6m, should be available as soon as USB 3.0 devices make their way into the market. Permanent Link

With the rise in adult-onset diabetes in the world, glucose management is becoming more and more important to many people. Many of them suffer horrible consequences of having diabetes and not finding out until tragedy strikes. Even so, very few people have been willing to get tested as they get older to make sure they haven't developed diabetes. Many advances have been made in the past decade making diabetes management much less stressful. Modern meters require only very tiny amounts of blood and you don't have to prick your finger tips. Many meters are just as accurate with blood samples from the hand or forearm. Once the reading has been taken, it's effectively trapped in the small pager-like device. It's very hard to get an idea of your daily trends or figure in the effects of stress and time of day on the tiny LCD displays. Bayer's Contour USB is the first easily computer connected glucometer. Accu-Chek's Aviva did come with a built in IR sender but it was not IRDA and required a special IR adapter. All of the other monitors that offer any type of PC connectivity require the purchase of a separate serial adapter cable. One-Touch actually makes a USB connector cable but they all cost almost more than the monitor. Finally, with Bayer's 2nd Glucose reading entrant, direct PC connection is instant. Using the free Glucofacts DELUXE software, you can upload your readings to your PC and you and your doctor can quickly review and adapt your medicine. Staying fit and trim are your best defenses against diabetes and insulin resistance but everyone can afford to occasionally have their blood checked to be sure that nothing sneaks up on them. Kudos to Bayer for advancing the development of this underutilized technology. Permanent Link

Point Grey wows us with their new video camera which they plan to debut at 2009 Intel Developer Forum. What looks like an HD-wannabe webcam is actually capable of pumping full 1080p video at an astounding 60fps.  The widened pipe of USB 3.0 actually may make high bandwidth devices cheaper now that they can push raw data through to the host computer's CPU.  Previous devices would have to include additional circuitry to compress the data before channeling to the host. The camera uses a 3 mega-pixel Sony CMOS sensor to capture the 1920x1080 video images. Since host controllers for SuperSpeed USB have yet to hit the market they've formed a special alliance with Fresco Logic. Fresco Logic's FL1000 controller is used in their test system via a PCI-Express USB 3.0 interface card. We'll have to wait patiently for the IDF 2009 to find out the price on either the card or the camera. The first host controllers we are likely to see will likely be included on ASUS motherboards and Fujitsu laptops, but we're still waiting on confirmation of a production date. Check back with us and we'll update as soon as they are available. Permanent Link

The Toshiba WUSB dock with dual antennas pointing upwards is powered by Alereon's AL5100/5350 chipset to cover UWB spectrum from 3.1 to 10.6Ghz.  In addition to meeting worldwide regulatory standards, the wireless notebook dock is equally capable as a wired counterpart by offering built-in DisplayLink video; 7.1 surround sound option; 4-port USB hub; 2 Sleep-n-Charge USB ports; and Ethernet. In details, the DisplayLink video card can deliver up to 1680x1050 thru DVI interface, and Toshiba throws in a second wireless radio to further improve performance.  The DynaDock Wireless U also has a convenient one-touch undock button to ensure all USB peripherals shut down properly when undocking.  That's certainly better than selecting every connected product to eject individually.  The WUSB driver is optimized as well to allow bi-directional isochronous support for wired USB video and audio products.  Otherwise, neither USB headsets nor external webcams would work wirelessly.  Toshiba DynaDock Wireless U will ship with a WUSB dongle and native XP/Vista support for a MSRP of $299, and Windows 7 driver is slated for release on October 22nd, the same day as the OS launch.

With 100 ft. range via an RF wireless connection, you can control your desktop, gaming rig, HTPC or conference room while you walk around. The USB RF connector can be hidden anywhere without hindrance. The small gyroscope in the 3.3 gram mouse senses motion with great accuracy, allowing you to not only control the mouse but to program open-air gestures.  The Gyration Air Mouse also works on a desk as a normal high-res laser mouse. Besides uses that truly warrant free movement, you might also consider this as an option for ergonomics. Take a break from being hunched over your keyboard and lean back and work in a more reclined position. The $99 price tag might be a little steep, but the cool factor definitely offsets it a bit.

Pinnacle's TVCenter 6 adds DVR and time-shifting software for recording shows for later watching.  Recordings can be saved in MPEG-2, DivX (off-line transcoding) or H.264 formats for permanent collections or transfer to other devices. They also included some additional software for video editing. Although only available for Windows XP, Vista and 7, special attention has been paid to making this a low-power CPU, netbook friendly nano device. This is reflected in their hardware requirements minimum being listed as Intel 1.6GHZ Atom and 256MB of RAM. This tiny unit will go on sale next week but only in Europe for around $80.  No hint of an ASTC version is mentioned so we are still stuck with these USB TV dongles for the time being. Permanent Link

The new Turbo mode targets netbook users compressing requested images on the way down to the browser greatly decreasing tethered bandwidth delays and data plan usage. The USB variant Opera@USB contains all the features of the original but can run off of a flash drive keeping all your settings and temporary files private and in your possession. These new features join a huge list of bonus features already present in Opera. While many of the features are available as user generated plugins for FireFox, the most popular Firefox plug-ins are polished and included natively in Opera.  Ad-Blocking, Windows 7-like tab preview thumbnails, fast Javascript engine, email, password management, mouse gestures, torrent downloads, skins, and customized searching are all built in and easily customizable.  On top of all that, the Opera Link function let's you synchronize your favorites, searches, notes and other settings from your PC or flash drive or smartphone version of Opera.  It's available for free download here. Another popular USB friendly variant is maintained and developed here. It contains all of the same features but is able to run off of a CD or read-only media and uses an alternate method to erase or store personal data. Permanent Link

Now that Sony has debuted this razor-thin A-series sharing the same characteristic, consumers might have even a more difficult time telling them apart.  Of course, after another look into the specs, you know what you are paying for. For starter, Sony A840 has a 2.8" 240x400 OLED versus 2.4" 240x320 LCD of the S540.  Note the extra amount of pixels which is for movies and slideshows.  Additionally, swapping out the LCD in favor of OLED gives better color reproduction and improves battery life, which in the case of A840, boasts 29 hours and 9 hours of music and video playback respectively.  Excess thickness is trimmed down to a mere 0.28", and weight reduced to 2.1 oz.  The case looks like it's plastic, but the shiny controls are more like made of aluminum. Also unique to the Sony A840 are S-master amplifier; noise-cancelling feature (must be used with the bundled headphones); content transfer compatibility with Sony Blu-ray recorders; and lyrics-audio sync (works more like Karaoke); and high bit-rate support for videos (10Mbps for AVC, 6Mbps for MPEG-4 / WMV).  Lastly, you can get it with 64GB, but the price tag is a staggering $442 USD.  The 16GB and 32GB will also be available at $265 and $331. Permanent Link

Seagate has the answer, and it's called the DockStar cradle.  Slide a FreeAgent Go into the cradle's slot, and DockStar's Gigabit Ethernet will magically make drive's content available for network access.  The DockStar conveniently provides three additional ports for those who have other brands of external USB drives. The underlying technology behind DockStar is same as Pogoplug.  Unlike the PogoPlug, however, the Seagate needs a AC adapter so it isn't as minimalist as the former.  The DockStar does offer the same web access to the shared files from any browsers and even iPhone provided you subscribe to the paid service for $29.99 a year.  The service also has an additional benefit of making a selected list of files visible on various social sites through RSS feeds.  The alternative is to install Pogoplug's software which makes the FreeAgent and other drives whether they are in NTFS, FAT32, EXT3, HFS+ visible to Windows, Mac and Linux.  The Seagate DockStar is priced the same as Pogoplug at $99. Permanent Link

Turns out it's actually latest R&D effort of a new Singapore-based start-up that promises to bring plug and play bi-directional remote access to the mass market.  The company bearing the same name of their iTwin 'cableless USB network cable' plans to make file sharing dead easy even for the uninitiated. The iTwin basically splits into two identical dongles, which are already paired with a encryption key so they supposedly don't need password nor user ID to establish a secure connection.  As the developers put it, iTwin is just like two ends of an invisible cable that pair two PCs together via Internet.  The video demo shows other PC's drive icon magically pops up as soon as there's a confirmed link.  There are still some questions left to be answered such as the underlying technology, scalability (i.e. 2 PC limitations) and physical security concerns.  iTwin is planned to hit retail sometime in the first half of 2010 for $99, and of course, it will come in pair.

It also makes the first true USB projector possible.  Sanwa's 400-PRJ001 mobile projector is capable of throwing up a 48.5" image just 2m from the wall, and the fact it can draw power and video feed from the same two USB ports deserves applause for engineering ingenuity.  If that's not good enough, the projector weighs at a mere 85g; in perspective, the bundled tripod also is 46g. Our only gripe is the brightness (10 ANSI lumens) or lack thereof.  The aspect ratio and resolution are also limited to 4:3 and 640x480 respectively.  So it would be difficult for Sanwa to convince most of us to drop $220 USD on a toy like this.  For serious business, better save up for something like a BenQ GP1. Permanent Link

The Zeppelin is a dual function device acting as both a USB PC speaker and an iPod speaker. Looking a bit more run of the mill than B&W's usual avant-garde designs, the Zeppelin Mini is about half the size of its enormous, award winning predecessor. Only about 1 ft. wide, the Mini has a top mounted swiveling mount with an iPhone dock connector. You can also hook up any ....og music player to the Mini as well via a headphone sized input jack in the rear.  The Zeppelin line distinguishes itself by using the USB connection and not the iPod's ....og headphone output to stream sound. The digital connection allows it to pull music off your device in full fidelity (as good as compressed music can be) and use its own high fidelity processors to create sound. While connected, the Mini can also act as a USB speaker, and simultaneously charge and synchronize your device.  So you can listen to great sound and be loading up your iPod at the same time. Unfortunately, all this tech comes at a price. You'll have to pony up $399 for this high end sound system which should be available in October. Permanent Link
